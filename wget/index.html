<p>It’s all too clear that artists are willing to sacrifice everything for their art, including self-interest, an unfortunate consequence of an economy that trades in exposure. In our perilously unequal society, most artists are <a href="http://powhida.tumblr.com/post/21452361650/why-are-most-artists-so-fucking-poor" target="_blank">poor</a>, and few understand how we might begin to change the situation. According to a recent <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com/#artists-report-back" target="_blank">report</a> by the artist-activist group BFAMFAPhD, only 10 percent of U.S. arts graduates make a living from their art. Yet the art market is booming; last year it nearly rebounded to its highest-ever level—the 2008 financial crash produced only a temporary dip—with <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/global-art-market-surged-to-66-billion-in-2013-report.html" target="_blank">$66 billion in sales</a>. I recently spoke with the art historian Julia Bryan-Wilson about artists’ remuneration and made the mistake of saying, “The problem is, there just isn’t enough money.” She corrected me immediately: “There is enough money—it’s just concentrated in the hands of the very few.”</p>

<p>While there will always be more artists than opportunities to earn income in the art market, cultural critics like Gregory Sholette and Ben Davis have suggested that we might make inroads in addressing this problem by considering the question “who is art for?” And today artists are starting to come together to connect their economic grievances to broader social concerns, as they strive to support the diverse art ecosystem outside the speculative art market. Take the artist-activist group <a href="http://www.wageforwork.com/" target="_blank">W.A.G.E.</a> (Working Artists and the Greater Economy), which has developed a <a href="http://www.wageforwork.com/certification/1/about-certification" target="_blank">certification system</a> for nonprofit institutions to voluntarily pay artists an amount defined as minimum compensation for their work. Another project pointing to solutions is <a href="http://www.artpractical.com/feature/standard_deviation/" target="_blank">Standard Deviation</a>, a worksheet designed by Helena Keefe and Patricia Maloney that poses a series of questions and presents flow charts that individual artists can use to make informed, ethical decisions about opportunities such as exhibiting for free at a nonprofit. Keefe and Maloney presented their project as part of UC Berkeley’s recent practicum “<a href="http://www.artpractical.com/issue/valuing-labor-in-the-arts/" target="_blank">Valuing Labor in the Arts</a>,” in which an inspiring group of cultural producers discussed strategies for artists to build agency and self-determination in an economy that privileges objects produced for speculative markets.</p>

<p>These projects are part of a larger solidarity movement—also including <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com/" target="_blank">BFAMFAPhD</a>, <a href="http://interferencearchive.org/" target="_blank">Interference Archive</a>, the <a href="http://www.artiststudioaffordabilityproject.org/" target="_blank">Artist Studio Affordability Project</a> (ASAP) and <a href="http://www.placeholderprojects.com/" target="_blank">Placeholder Projects</a> (a project I am involved with)—to renew public dialogue about providing greater access to education, debt relief and studio space. Each of these projects implicitly shifts the discussion from artists’ individual responsibilities to the ways in which artists can act collectively. While these are recent efforts, they remain connected to activism of the not-so-distant past that sought to provide greater equity and representation in society for people of color, women and other marginalized groups. One of the challenges for artists now is to see ourselves as part of broader existing struggles instead of treating artistic labor as unique. Art may be special, but work is work.</p>

<p>As promising as they are, these projects are not without their contradictions and shortcomings. At a recent panel on alternative economies, the artist and filmmaker Linda Goode Bryant pointedly asked, “Why do we still have to do this? Are we just perpetuating the mistakes of the previous generation?” Goode Bryant candidly remarked that her own historic project Just Above Midtown (JAM), an exhibition space for African-American artists, ultimately did not accomplish its goals. She described how it slowly transformed from an alternative to the exclusionary gallery system into a pipeline to it. Her perspective is important for two reasons: first, today’s solidarity efforts are connected to a long, less visible social history, and second, no one lives outside global capitalism. Even when people choose to live and work according to different principles and values, the imperatives of capitalism can eventually change the terms.</p>
<p>Accepting that there is no place “outside capitalism” may also be a powerful antidote to the abstractions of revolutionary theory. Pragmatic reform from within institutions at the level of public policy, law and infrastructure may require us to use some of the tools of the system, even if it gives rise to feelings of co-optation and complicity—and the dreaded accusation of “selling out.” Worrying about how to get by is unavoidable (for those of us without inherited wealth), and as the artist Molly Crabapple <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/filthy-lucre" target="_blank">observes</a>, “Not talking about money is a tool of class war.” The tension between art and money evokes an ancient dichotomy between the market and the monastery. The myth of artistic purity contributes to the general unease that arises when artists discuss the terms and conditions of their own labor, even if we accept that most of us aren’t in it for the money. Talking money requires artists to reject purist attachments to autonomy and climb down from their ivory towers and isolated studios into the muck of business. Acting as if we are somehow above or outside of global capitalism is not a form of agency—it’s a form of delusion.</p>

<p>At a recent panel for Sarah Thornton’s book <em>33 Artists in 3 Acts</em> at the New Museum in New York, Andrea Fraser addressed the powerful allure of myths about being an artist. Fellow panelist Laurie Simmons confessed that her parents started calling her an artist as a child because that was the only identity that could explain her difference. Thornton countered by saying, “The art world is extremely conformist!” An identity premised on being “unique” seems to be part of our aversion to working cooperatively. We know that the market works for very few of us, and yet the promises of prestige, recognition and acceptance associated with this orthodoxy of individualism strongly appeal to our hopes and desires. It’s clear to me that we need other narratives that can fulfill some of those deeply held needs if we are to change the situation not only of the poor artist but also of the broader class of the working poor. Precariousness is the common condition for artists and non-artists in the United States and many other countries with endemic inequality.</p>
<div class='pullquote center'>
<p><em>Art may be special, but work is work</em></p>

<p>For groups proposing reforms or building new infrastructure within capitalist systems, there is still a monumental struggle for funding, particularly in the United States. We can’t simply redistribute our limited income to fund one another’s projects. Crowdfunding fails to address the structural problems of income inequality and the concentration of wealth generated from both income and capital ownership in the upper class. According to the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, the top 10 percent of the U.S. population took home <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0" target="_blank">more than half</a> of the total income generated in 2012. Income inequality and wealth concentration are distinct but closely related problems that corrupt the electoral process, restrict access to quality public education, enable continued environmental damage and adversely affect all levels of representative democracy. Artists’ activist efforts need to be linked with other anti-inequality initiatives, including <a href="http://strikedebt.org/" target="_blank">Strike Debt</a>, <a href="http://rootstrike.com/" target="_blank">Root Strike</a>, <a href="https://mayday.us/" target="_blank">MayDay.US</a> and myriad other progressive movements that appear fractured today. In order to address the problems created by decades of increasing income inequality and wealth concentration, the left may need to look to European coalition models in electoral politics or the German stakeholder model for engaging private enterprise. A coalition of artist-led advocacy groups, economic/social justice organizations, environmental activists and other progressives could powerfully counterbalance the forces of privatization that extract so much value from our labor.</p>
<p>If we have any hope of changing the terms of capitalism (before it changes us irrevocably), we need to effect change throughout the entire art ecosystem. We need to encourage greater solidarity, in part by reaching out to artists who have access to levers of power in the vertical towers of selectivity like Art Basel Miami Beach. Artists whose voices the system has amplified need to speak up and agitate for change in solidarity with everyone down the line if we are to address the conservatism of our new gilded age, which is not about thought policing (as it was during the culture wars) but rather about the absurd levels of income inequality and wealth concentration. If left unchecked and unchallenged, this inequality will reach levels never before seen anywhere in the world—a prospect that should concern artists as much as it does all workers.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2700" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you William. I am happy you are helping bring this out in the open, it is very important. I have a degree in art and have been showing art since my graduation in 2004. I left the &#8220;artworld&#8221; (whatever that means now) to go to work as an architect. I now work with a firm that values my aesthetic and artistic knowledge and pays me a living wage for my skills. After a number of years being involved in the fine arts I became disenfranchised with the idealism and naivety that artists have about the greatness or their ideas and identity. Most artists take absolutely no interest in the economic side of things because they are too lazy or stupid to understand commerce and their place in it. I also feel that as a rationale for this lack interest artists take the purist stance that their &#8220;work&#8221; is not about the money. This is clearly not the case for many people because they continue to form power cliques around other artists and people who might give them money. I feel sad for this whole situation and believe that things will not always be this way.</p>

The object is only a part of that investment; we also are investing in the career of the artist, the ideas that the artist is exploring and, hopefully, the long-term possibility that the artist can continue production. The object can, only then, retain and increase in value. We are hopefully also investing in the improvement of our daily surroundings. These things all contain value. They are also initially extremely difficult to quantify. really, it boils down to the saying &#8216;put your money where your mouth is&#8217;. If you support the ideas and the career of the artist, you are willing to back that artist with cash. What you get in return is the object and the pleasure that comes with that object. The cash payback happens over many years and is a by-product. Of course, we now live in a time when &#8216;investing&#8217; in housing must show dividends in less than a decade. &#8216;Long-term&#8217; has been distorted like everything else.</p>
<p>@ Chris V. Nicholson: Question b is a good question but the reality is we need artists to be able to make things that the world may have no interest in purchasing. Art is not completely about the end product of the effort of making. Sometimes it is the process of discovery that goes along with that making; the ideas that can only happen through the process of making. The question is then how do we quantify that effort? This is fundamentally why a business model will never fully apply to art and artists. We try to force art to comply with a business model at the peril of art.</p>

What are some things we can do right now to solve it, collectively or individually?

The paragraph that gets my attention starts with &#8220;Accepting that there is no place “outside &#8230;” (I also love what Deleuze does with that notion in &#8220;To Have Done with Judgment,&#8221; juxtaposing war and combat.) Here is one of my contributions to visualizing the field: <a href="http://adelheidmers.org/aweb/artsorgs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://adelheidmers.org/aweb/artsorgs.htm</a>, focusing on sites. Each has its limits, histories, jargons and economies. It&#8217;s well worth teasing those out, and each time I bring this out, more is added.</p>

The 2014 HHS poverty guidelines put a couple with one child&#8217;s poverty rate at $19,790. What other profession counts $25k as success? The irony is BFAMFAPhD did a slight disservice to their own fantastic work by setting such a low bar, but then that is what this article is all about, the bar is way too low.</p>

I can make physical objects but I work in hybrid forms of performance, New Media, installation, projection mapping etc..  The value of art in a community is quantifiable.  Artists are at the forefront of any real estate gentrification or revitalization.  America is in a post-industrial, post-disaster period.  Funding for all the arts and aesthetic research should be part of any rebuilding or revitalization plan. It&#8217;s like seed money.</p>

As much as I&#8217;d love to deny commissions without at least 50% up front and balance due for delivery, what do we do when even a smaller portion is absolute necessity for survival? The entire judicial system in claims against non-paying patrons must also work in our favor. Here in the states, the same old game applies: If you have the money to represent you against claims, you win! Worse yet, those who get away with anything don&#8217;t show a smidgen of shame nor is an apology to be expected. I&#8217;m all in for change. Now then, where can we work while the dust settles? My well valued positivity and patience wears thin.</p>

That is why the stereotype &#8216;starving artist&#8217; still exists. There is no artistic voice to replace it. Just name one fine artist that is known to the public like Kanye West or Justin Bieber. There is none.  It&#8217;s as if we are obsolete. We hear from many other creative people i.e;. singers, rappers, media personalities with no talent whats-so-ever and so on.  It takes a lot of imagination to be an Artist and even more to make a living at it. If we just create what we think people will buy then the Art world will become like stagnate water where everything dies and the creative imagination of the world will soon follow.</p>
